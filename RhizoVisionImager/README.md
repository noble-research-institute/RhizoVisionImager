# ![RhiZoVision Imager Logo](./rvimagerlogo.png) RhizoVision Imager

RhizoVision Analyzer is an application that connects to multiple Basler USB 3.0
vision cameras to take picture of an object from multiple views or take multiple
parts of an object. The program supports taking pictures from cameras using
barcode reader.

#### Downloading
The software binary can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/2585881).

The source code repository is located [here](https://github.com/rootphenomicslab/RhizoVisionImager).

#### Running the Program

The program opens a GUI where it automatically connects to Basler USB 3.0 vision cameras.
All the connected cameras are shown in the left pane arranged in the ascending order of
the camera serial numbers. Each camera is given a number from one to the number of cameras
in the in the ascending order of the camera serial numbers. Upon starting the program
displays live view of the camera with the smallest serial number. The live view camera
can be changed from the menu View. The program needs a save location to store the captured
images. The file name of each image capture from each camera is appended by c1, c2 ... etc.
The program never deletes or overwrites the images if they are already present. Instead,
the file names are appended with p1, p2, ... etc.
